## 🚩 Tips

Like many things in life, with GPT-4, you get out what you put in. In this case, providing more context, instructions, and guidance will usually produce better results.

Here are some tips and techniques to improve:

- **Split your prompts:**
Try breaking your prompts and desired outcome across multiple steps. Keeping prompts to have a single outcome has shown to produce better results than combined prompts. For example, ask for a review, then ask for a refactor based on the review response. This may become less important in time as LLMs increase their token limit.

- **Give Examples:**
Provide expected inputs, data and outputs to improve accuracy quality. 📝

- **Be Specific:**
Don’t be afraid to list exactly what you want, what you know, what is needed, and what not to include. 🔎

- **Ask it to Reflect:**
A technique called reflexion has been shown to increase GPT4’s accuracy. Basically ask it ‘Why were you wrong?’ or get it to reflect and review its own response. 🤔

## 🔗 A multi-prompt approach (prompt chaining)

can be used to update, refactor, and review a piece of code. A well-designed set of prompts is one where each has separated concerns and singular responsibilities.

### 1. Modernize and add best practices
---

by getting GPT-4 to re-write your code into the style you want. This step will generally result in coherent output, in the style you want, but may introduce errors, so we do it first.

**Prompt:**

```
Review the following code and re-write it to modern es6 programming standards and formatting:

[insert code here]
```

### 2. Review your code for logical errors and security concerns
---

Get recommendations to improve any logical or security concerns introduced. It’s important that we don’t ask for a refactor, just the reasoning behind wanting the refactor.

**Prompt:**

```
Review your provided code 'tempFunction' for any logical or security concerns and provide a list of recommendations.
```

### 3. Validate the recommendations (reflexion)
---

Validate the provided recommendations. Reflexion is a powerful technique to improve the accuracy of the initial recommendations and try to eliminate any hallucinations. This is not always required but it is worth asking if you are unsure about any recommendations.

**Prompt:**

```
Review your above recommendations. Tell me why you were wrong and if any recommendations were overlooked or incorrectly added?
```

### 4. Write the Code
---

Combine your reviews, recommendations and feedback to get GPT-4 to write your new function.

**Prompt:**

```
Re-write the 'tempFunction' function based off your review and recommendations.
```

### 5. Create Tests
---

Create some simple tests that we can run locally and validate the results

**Prompt:**

```
Create two [ define technology ] tests for the above 'tempFunction' function. One that is expected to pass and one that is expected to fail.
```

## Re-write Prompt

Let's see if we can get GPT4 to make or average prompts and turn them into "voyage inspirant" type mastery prompts.

**Prompt:**

```
[your prompt]

Re-write the above text to be more verbose and include a lot of superfluous description about each thing, use very painting language.
```

## ChatGPT prompt optimizer

**Prompt:**

```
I'll provide a chatGPT prompt. You'll ask questions to understand the audience and goals, then optimize the prompt for effectiveness and relevance using the principle of specificity.
```

<sup>[⬆️ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Ask for alternatives

If you're not satisfied with your solution you can ask to ChatGPT to give you alternatives

**Prompt:**

```
I'll provide you with a piece of code that I made and 
I need you give me alternatives to do the same in other way:

[INSERT YOUR CODE HERE]
```

## Documentation / Explaination

### Adding Documentation
---

> [!NOTE]

```
I don't know how to code, but I want to understand how this works. Explain the following code to me in a way that a non-technical person can understand. Always use Markdown with nice formatting to make it easier to follow. Organize it by sections with headers. Include references to the code as markdown code blocks in each section. The code:

[insert code here]
```

Prompt 2#:

```
Please add comprehensive documentation for [file or module name], including clear and concise explanations of its purpose, design, and implementation. Consider including examples of how to use the module, as well as any relevant diagrams or flow charts to help illustrate its workings. Ensure that the documentation is easily accessible to other developers and is updated as the module evolves. Consider using documentation tools such as inline comments, markdown files, or a documentation generator to simplify the process.
